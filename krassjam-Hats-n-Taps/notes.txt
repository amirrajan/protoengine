#KRASS JAM 4

Krass Jam THEMES:
1. A shooting game where you drive tanks with puppies and you're a cyborg.
2. A student project where you ostracize familiar scents from outside the game.
3. A puzzle game where you collect hats for the mega-bonus.

Most likely idea - 3rd

My Rules:
- Coding almost (exception: stb-image) everything from scratch using only a c compiler.
- Compiler Tiny C - under 2mb uncompressed
- Using opengl


Notes on code:
- check out the main loop time - we're always following behind
  - deactivated for now since it's logging evert tick
- clean up opengl.c - remove all shit from framebuffer stuff test
- check out dds loader - to maybe remove stb_image
