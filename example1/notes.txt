This is a very simple example of usage.

Explanation

1. Declare the Texture
	Texture hat;

2. Load the image onto the texture (at game start)
	void game_init()

3. On every tick draw it (a tick is every 16ms)
	void game_tick(const float delta)

4. When the game is done (exit), unload resources
	void game_terminate()

---------

use load_texture("res/FILENAME.png"); to load the texture
use unload_texture(VARIABLE); to unload the texture
